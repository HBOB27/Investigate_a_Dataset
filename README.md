Investigate-no show appointments

All of us took or will take a medical appointment in the future, and some appointments maybe assigned after several months due to high demand on a specific doctor. For sure not 100% of patients will attend their appointments! So we collect a data from a medical center that contains some information of each patient and will try to find out if we can predict if this patient will show up his appointment or not.
